Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler 

Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

How to set up....

We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GitHub Pages to host your finished site.

Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

Instructions:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

Check your train times below!
